# WeWantBlueShamans

This addon simply makes Shamans blue in Classic Era without causing massive taint errors.
I just could not bear pink Shamans and other addons out there cause major bugs to raid frames.

Shamans will be blue in

- raid frames
- nameplates
- chat
- guild list
- who list
- and more ...
